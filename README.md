# Neural Network Charity Analysis: A Neural Network Model

## Overview
This project used the TensorFlow platform in Python to develop and analyze a neural network for classifying charitable donations. The aim was to model training and testing data using machine learning to predict the success of these donations, to plan for best utilization of resources in the future.

## Results
* Data Preprocessing
Notable columns were identified and separated for preprocessing. The columns "EIN" and "NAME" were removed because they provided identification information irrelevant for modelling purposes. The target variable was the column "IS_SUCCESSFUL", based on results from previous allocations. The variables retained as features were "APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "STATUS", INCOME_AMT", SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", and "ASK_AMT."

* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
